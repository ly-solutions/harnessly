// The drops: what waits for the person and was put away from the smart notice (a code, a permission, a question, a
// machine in the red) does not go: it stays as a small drop in the chat's right column until it is answered, and is
// the only reminder of it (the notice does not bring it back by itself). The smart notice's binding says what is in
// the drops; the column draws them; a drop pressed asks the notice to take it back (and plays the flight from the drop
// into the card). A page's state, not saved: a reload brings what still waits back to the notice.
