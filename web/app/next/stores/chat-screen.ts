// The full screen each chat was on, as the person left it: a design, a kit, a document, an app or a merge request opened
// on the whole window from that chat (the address carries `?chat=`). Coming back to the chat — from the sidebar, after a
// reload, a day later, from another tab — opens that screen again; leaving it for the chat by Back (or its «назад»)
// puts the chat as it is. The rest of a chat's view is kept by its own stores: the right pane and its tab
// (stores/pane-state.ts), the chat's place and size over a design (features/designly/site-layout.ts), the review's
// (bindings/review-app.tsx). This browser's only: localStorage, the most recent chats.
