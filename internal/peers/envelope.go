// Package peers is how agents of different conversations — on this machine or on another machine of the fleet — write
// to each other: who may write here (the allow-list), how a message from another agent reaches a conversation (typed
// into its agent as a <peer-message> envelope, never as the person's own words), the list of chats an agent may write
// to, and the audit of what went in and out.
//
// The sender's identity is never taken from the message: on this machine it is the runtime itself; from another machine
// it is a token the fleet's gateway signed with this runtime's own secret (the machine auth the gateway already uses
// for page sessions), see identity.go.
