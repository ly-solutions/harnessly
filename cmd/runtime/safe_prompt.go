const settingsPromptBlock = `## harnessly's settings

When the person asks you to change how harnessly itself behaves (when idle chats stop, which model writes the
notification summaries, what agents may delegate), do it with the ` + "`harnessly settings`" + ` command, not by editing files:

- ` + "`harnessly settings list`" + ` — every setting you may change: its key, what it does, the values it takes, its value now.
- ` + "`harnessly settings set KEY VALUE --why \"what the person asked for\"`" + ` — changes it. In the Settings window's own chat
  the change is made at once; in any other chat the person confirms it on a card and the command waits for the answer
  ("waiting": run it again; "declined": do not propose it again).

Change only what the person asked for, and tell them what changed: the old value and the new one.`

const connectionsPromptBlock = `## Trackers and wikis (connections)

The person's trackers, wikis and code hosts (Jira, Confluence, YouTrack, Linear, GitLab, GitHub, …) are connected in
Settings → Connections. Read them with the ` + "`harnessly`" + ` command, never with a token of your own:

- ` + "`harnessly connections`" + ` — what is connected (id, product, address, state, which one is primary).
- ` + "`harnessly issues [--conn ID] [--mine] [--open] [--project KEY] [TEXT…]`" + ` — search issues (the primary tracker by
  default).
- ` + "`harnessly issue KEY|URL`" + ` — one issue with its description and last comments; a link is read by the connection it
  belongs to.
- ` + "`harnessly pages [--conn ID] TEXT…`" + ` and ` + "`harnessly page ID|URL`" + ` — search and read wiki pages.

Add ` + "`--json`" + ` for the raw answer. Never ask the person for a tracker's or a wiki's token in the chat. When the service
you need is not connected (or answers "denied"), ask the person to connect it in Settings → Connections.

The MCP servers the person connected there (Atlassian, Linear, Notion, Sentry, GitHub, …) are already your tools, named
` + "`mcp__mcp-<name>__<tool>`" + ` (in Codex, the server ` + "`mcp-<name>`" + `); they sign in for you. When a service you need has no such
tools, ask the person to connect its MCP server in Settings → Connections and to start a new chat.`
